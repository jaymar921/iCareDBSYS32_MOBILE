# iCARE Database 2
---------------------------------
# General description
iCare Pet Services is a mobile application and web application that records the data of the pet owners into the database. It keeps the records of the services that have been provided such as vaccination, deworming, vet assistance, pet breeding, and anti-flea. Pet owners will be categorized depending on the type of animal and will have unique identification in accessing the information. In addition, if the pet is still alive there will be no limitation on the number of pets being registered into the database. Any pet owners need to cater a care and needs for their pets. We have noticed the struggles in this process by uneasy services in gathering the data and giving services for the pets in any agencies, businesses, and barangays. We are fixing the usual way that were in all the data of a pet recorded in a piece of papers or envelopes. 

# Basic Operations

Services related to regulation and utilization of available health care and assistance program like iCare Pet Services has regular hours for operation in the barangay or municipality. The vet needs some basic information of the pet, especially when bringing them in for the first time on the provided schedule, the pet’s procedure will admit the pet with a nurse and gain an accurate weight. It may recommend that the pet has a pre-operative blood test for all cats over 8 years and all dogs over 6 years to check organ function or if they need additional support such as intravenous fluids. The pet will have a nurse who stays with them throughout the procedure to monitor. The names and doses of all pets’ medication must be provided through the system so that the vet will automatically record. The kind of food that the animal eats in order not to serve them inappropriately and to check their habits on how they eat and drink normally. Their toilet habits must also be checked. The behavior of the pet is also the number one concern so we must also ask for any recent tick bites, medical records, including vaccine history. The pet will then receive their premedication, which includes an injection to reduce anxiety and relax muscles and some pain relief.
The pet owners may also need to pay for emergency services if their pet gets hurt or sick, and those can add additional strain to their budget. Charges are based on time, expertise involved, and the extent of supplies and services provided. Keeping up with the pet’s health from the pet owner’s mobile device has never been easier! With the new app, they will have all their pet’s health information in the palm of their hands. Consider it as a pet’s personal organizer app.
Customers (Pet Owners) who forget their account passwords may request a reset token via Mobile Application, the system will send a verification code to their email for an account reset. If the customers no longer have access to their email addresses, alternatively they can use their mobile number to receive a notice. As for employees, they can follow the way customers retrieve their account or the administrators may assist them to retrieve their accounts.
